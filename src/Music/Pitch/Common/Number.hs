-- The number portion of an interval (i.e. second, third, etc).

-- Note that the interval number is always one step larger than number of steps spanned by
-- the interval (i.e. a third spans two diatonic steps). Thus 'number' does not distribute
-- over addition:

-- > number (a + b) = number a + number b - 1
